        Overview
    <div class = "flight">
        <div class = "text">
            Fight N’ Flight is a two-player game developed in C++ inspired by retro arcade games like Galaga,
             featuring pixel-art design. Gameplay consists of constant shooting from both players. The two 
             players must move up and down the screen to avoid the others fire. There is also a missile
              special attack that has a cooldown after use and other obstacles that can block the other player
              . The first player that’s health drops to zero losses.

        <div class="text">This project was completed by a team of six programmers using C++ and the game development
             library SFML. My role was design lead and UI programmer. Responsibilities of this role included designing
              the user interfaces and making the sure the game provides a good user experience. In addition, I
               designed all game assets and backgrounds as well as assisted coded the graphical user interfaces. </div>

        <div class="text">The goal of this project was to create a fun and engaging game that could be played by two players.
             The game was designed to be simple and easy to learn but also challenging and competitive. The GUI should be

            Performance Indicators
        </div>
        <div class ="text">
            The key performance indicator in terms of user experience is the user interface responsiveness. The game should launch
            quickly and display the menu to the user within a certain benchmark of time. All the buttons should be functional
            and followed by quick page load times. The most important aspect is the responsiveness of the game characters when
            moving and firing during gameplay as well as the health bar updating when damage is taken.

            An important takeaway from this project was learning how to develop a project in a larger team. When not directed 
            properly larger teams can have lower productivity and struggle to make a quality product, so this project taught me
            invaluable skills in teamworking and project management. This included breaking problems down into their fundamental
            challenges and assigning each task to the team member best suited to the task whether it be design, development or 
            leadership roles. Learning how to use project management software’s like confluence and working in an agile development
            environment highlighted the importance of frequent communication and continuously incorporating feedback from other
            team members and testing.

            The process of song creation is highly intricate, often requiring a range of expertise and coordination among 
            musicians and technicians, which can be exclusive and inefficient. The solution aims to address this be developing
             neural network-based AI model capable of processing inputs from a guitar and generating a cohesive musical
              composition. By implementing this system with a user-friendly interface, it simplifies the music creation
               process but also makes it more accessible, enabling individuals without specialized skills to craft songs with 
               the assistance of advanced AI tools.

                This project is a full year software development capstone project. It was completed in a group of 4 with each
                 member having a different focus. My role on this team involved python development on the generative neural
                 network as well as front end design and development.

        <div class ='text'>Tools that were implemented for this project are the IDE VSCode, version control software Github as
            well as microsoft teams for collaboration. Numerous machine learning development libraries were also implemented for the

        to create the wireframes and mockups for the user interface.

            The goal of this project was to create a user friendly interface that allows users to create music using a guitar
            and the AI model. The interface should be easy to navigate and have clear navigational paths. First a set of system
             specifications including interface requirements were created after the problem definition. Examples include!!!

            Once what the system needs to be able to do is clearly laid out then performance requirements are decided on. These
              can be thought of as benchmarks that if not met the system has failed from a user perspective.

            For this project the user-centered design approach was important to the process. Multiple rounds of user testing were
             completed. By continuously testing prototypes of the software with real users who have different levels of knowledge in
              music and technology, I ensured the final product not only met their expectations but provides a seamless user experience 
              using the feedback gained from users. By splitting the survey into categories technical assessment, creativity, 
              originality, and user experience the team can have insights into the performance and usability of each aspect of the system.
