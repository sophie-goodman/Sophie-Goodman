        <h1>Problem Definition</h1>
        <p>The song creation process is inherently complex, often 
            necessitating the collaboration of multiple musicians
             and technicians. This complexity can make the process
              exclusive and inefficient, creating barriers for
               individuals without access to specialized skills or
                equipment. The proposed solution seeks to simplify
                 this process by developing a neural network-based
                  AI model. This AI will process guitar inputs to
                   generate cohesive musical compositions, outputting
                    a five-track MIDI file that includes bass, drums,
                     guitar, piano, and strings. The model will be
                      trained on multiple musical datasets with multi-track
                       piano rolls, allowing it to generate melodies 
                       and rhythms influenced by user input. The scope
                        of the project prioritizes the model's core 
                        functionality and its ability to produce unique
                         outputs based on instrumental input, rather
                          than focusing on user interface design or
                           genre specification.</p>

        <h1>Project Goals</h1>
        <p>The project's primary goal is to make music creation more
             accessible and efficient for a broad audience. By automating
              the generation of musical compositions, the AI model aims
               to lower the barriers to entry into the music industry,
                enabling even novice users to create complex musical
                 pieces. The project seeks to streamline the music
                  creation process and foster innovation by providing
                   users with unique compositions that reflect their
                    input.</p>

    <div class="design">
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>The design of Melody Mixer features an interactive
             Graphical User Interface (GUI) paired with a Generative
             Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate music based on
              user-provided chords and melody. Users input an eight-bar
               guitar melody as a MIDI file, which the system processes
                using a pre-trained generator to extract features like
                 tempo, style, beat resolution, and pitch. The GUI does
                  not include the format of the input.</p>

        <h1>User Interface and Experience</h1>
        <p>The frontend of the application was initially sketched 
            as a low-fidelity prototype using the drawing software
             Procreate to determine the best layout. Subsequently,
              a high-fidelity prototype was created using the design
               software Figma, detailing the user interface, aesthetics,
                and navigational aspects without any code. Feedback 
                from group members and potential users was gathered 
                to identify unclear elements and improve the design 
                before coding.
        </br>
    </br>
            Key usability and design principles such as consistency,
             optimizing operation, ease of use, and satisfaction were
              prioritized. These principles influenced button placement,
               the inclusion of instructions, and a stylized rainbow
                aesthetic.
